# Class:
# A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. 
# Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. 
# Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. 
# Properties and Methods form a central entity called Class
# Class is an abstraction of some entity which contains common set of properties and methods
